## Coding Demo for iHomer presentation

First up; get everything that is required

There should be some tools installed on your system. Gulp is a requirement for using gulp serve
`npm install -g gulp` (might be required to run elevated)

Then the local dependencies
`npm install`
`bower install`

Two commands need to run in parallel (basic polymer-starter-kit and additional simple websocket server)
Run `node index.js`
Run `gulp serve` 


### Gratefully used the following projects

#### Polymer starter kit
